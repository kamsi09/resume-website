My Portfolio website using the ReactJS framework

I explicitly built this website without any frameworks such as Bootstrap and is intended to be a started application for those to build upon. All resume data is encapsulated in the resumeData.js file and is passed in as props to all the other components to centralize data management.

1. Clone/Download the repo.
2. Run  ``` npm install ```.
3. Run ```npm start``` to spin the up the local dev server port 3000.(http://localhost:3000).
